## Book Sharing Application Allow
1.	public listing of books and their associated data
2.	option for user login and registration flow
3.	for logged in users CRUD flow for books and their info : only admin can delete or edit book.
                                                             (username: admin, password: zaq1ZAQ!)

To simplify initial dev flow I have used json-server to simulate REST APIs.

## As Expected:

1.	Build the app using latest Angular CLI - 10.0.8
2.	Use own markup and css for styling, use svg for images.
3.	Use NgRx for state management.
4.	Write unit tests for most of the components using Jest ->  Statements - 68.75%, Branches - 31.58%, Functions -                                                              48.61%,  Lines - 65.81%
5.	Checked that application is accessible.
6.	Write Storybook stories for card & footer component.
7.	Two themes for the app â€“ light and dark which we can change from header
8.	Published code to GitHub with proper commit messages.
